# Sjekkliste
- Play around with colours, advice was lighter hues, (pastell is all the rage now).
- Gihub API gives access to account information, ask comrades about this.
- Add shadow to navbar. Create some depth on page
- Make navbar tiny (invisible) on mobil.
- Prescence icons are humongous, refine them.
- Keep colour palette minimalistic and apply colours consistently.
- Mind the 1-2-3-whammy:
  1. Face.
  2. Who am I.
  3. Skillset.
- Glassmorphisme is cool when applied correctly
  - Mind overused, performance and uniqueness value
- Custom fonts.
